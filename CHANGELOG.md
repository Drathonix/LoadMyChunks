# Load My Chunks Version 1.0.5

## Load My Computers - Computercraft Integration

Chunk Loaders (of all colors) can now be attached to turtles! They will chunkload any chunks they enter while following the LMC Chunkloading rules.

Chunk Loader and Lagometer blocks now have peripherals with various functions. See [this page](https://github.com/Drathonix/LoadMyChunks/wiki/peripherals)

## Bug Fixes

Patched [#13](https://github.com/Drathonix/LoadMyChunks/issues/13): LevelChunkMixin causing Block Entities to double tick occasionally. 

Patched [#12](https://github.com/Drathonix/LoadMyChunks/issues/12) Made the mod's chunk data thread safe, to fix a relevant conflict on *some* systems with mods like C^2ME which thread chunk loading.
