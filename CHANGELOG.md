## Load My Computers - Computercraft Integration

Lagometer and Chunkloader blocks both have peripherals.
Chunkloader peripheral extends the lagometer one.

Chunkloaders can be attached to turtles to allow them to load chunks. These have the same peripheral as the placed ones.

Loading Turtles use chunk loading system as the placed ones and will follow the LMC chunk loading rules. 
Loading Turtles will force load destination chunks before unforcing the start chunk.
